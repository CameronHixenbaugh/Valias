VALIAS DECENTRALIZED NFT MARKETPLACE

CREATORS*** Skyler Vautier and Cameron Hixenbaugh

-Valias is a complete NFT marketplace built with Cadence, Flow's resource-oriented smart contract programming language.


-Deploying specialized contracts, to mint NFTs, and integrate multiple types of currency to help users create and liquidate digital assests.

-This projet is written in multiple languages, including but not limited to Javascript, Typescript, Cadence, HTML...

-This project requires Docker

-This project requires NodeJS v14.x 

-This project requires flow-cli v0.28.0 


-Valias is a USD-based NFT exchange that is built with Flow’s unique and powerful infrastructure and uses Blocto as a third-party wallet service. Flow is a new generation of blockchain and uses Multi-role architecture, this design is unique, allowing the network to scale to serve billions of users without reducing safety or decentralization. This new ledger protects users and their NFTS, guaranteeing the privacy of each and every transaction. Valias is just like Flow in the way that it is an improved version of its predecessors. Valias provides a peer distributed exchange that allows every NFT to reside within its Vault-like infrastructure, all while creating a user-friendly interface. Valias is creating a place where anyone can affordably and safely create, sell, or buy NFTs. The use of making everyday items into a digital version is a process that is becoming more familiar every day. NFTs are the future, now wouldn’t you like to help create it?

1. Web App (Valias.io)

-A true dapp, client-only web app. This is a complete web application built with React that demonstrates how to build a static website deployed to the environment IPFS and connects directly to the Flow blockchain using @onflow/fcl. @onflow/fcl handles authentication and authorization of Flow accounts, signing transactions, and querying data using using Cadence scripts.

2. A Web Server! 
We love decentralization, but servers are still very useful, and this one's no exception. The code in this project demonstrates how to connect to Flow using Flow JavaScript SDK from a Node JS backend. It's also chalk-full of handy patterns you'll probably want to use for more complex and feature-rich blockchain applications, like storing and querying events using a SQL database (Postgres). The API demonstrates how to send transactions to the Flow blockchain, specifically for minting NFTS on Valias (non-fungible tokens).

3. Cadence Code | Valias/cadence

Cadence smart contracts, scripts & transactions for your viewing pleasure. This folder contains all of the blockchain logic for the marketplace application. Here you will find contratcs for fungible token and non-fungible token (NFT) smart contract implementations, as well as the scripts and transactions that interact with them. It also contains examples of how to test your Cadence code.

What are NFTS on Valias
NFTS are digital assests created in a peer environment, under the hood they're non-fungible tokens (NFTs) stored on the Flow blockchain).

Items can be purchased from the marketplace with fungible tokens.
